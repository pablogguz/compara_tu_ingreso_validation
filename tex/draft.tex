This methodology note develops a transparent and simple framework to estimate aggregate income distributions in Spain exploiting the availability of granular inequality metrics. Specifically, I leverage administrative tax records and demographic data at the census tract-level to reconstruct local income distributions assuming log-normality. National and regional income distributions are subsequently derived as population-weighted mixtures of these tract-level distributions. This approach leverages well-documented regularities in how incomes are distributed within neighborhoods, and the resulting estimates closely match observed income percentiles in validation tests. I implement this framework in \href{https://comparatuingreso.es/}{comparatuingreso.es}, a publicly available web platform that enables Spanish households to calculate their relative position within the income distribution. While the focus is on Spain, this approach can be readily adapted to other countries with comparable administrative data available.

\section{Introduction}

Understanding the income distribution is crucial for economic analysis and policy design, yet its measurement remains challenging. In this paper, I propose a transparent and simple method to estimate national-level income distributions when granular income and inequality measures are available. Using detailed administrative data from Spain covering over 36,000 census tracts, I show that local income distributions are well-approximated by log-normal distributions, with predicted statistics matching observed values within 5\% on average. I estimate the national income distribution as a population-weighted mixture of tract-specific log-normals. The method provides a flexible framework for analyzing income distributions when individual data is unavailable but detailed geographic information exists.

The rest of this note is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:data} describes the data sources, their coverage, and scope. Section \ref{sec:method} outlines the methodology, including the modeling of local income distributions, their aggregation and the calculation of the relevant validation metrics. Section \ref{sec:results} presents validation results, and Section 5 discusses potential extensions and applications of the framework to other contexts.
